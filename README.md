###Assignment 13.1 of the AcadGild Front End Web Dev Course

Create three different components like home, about, contact us.  
Then create routing for them in App component(using router-outlet).

Note:
* Run `npm run serve` to start app
* Roles link was placed to show 'PageNotFound' page
* Used Hash style URL (because typing in the path directly was not working and  
 when I refreshed the browser it redirected me to 404 page.)
